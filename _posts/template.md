review: |
  Some people believe GitHub is not your CV. I agree with the idea that a profile
  without context is meaningless, but rather than sit back and complain, I decided
  to do something about it.
  This weekend project of mine is designed to help developers showcase their work.
  It's a place to curate your code (open source or not), and provide potential
  employers an opportunity to see how you think, how you work, the context of your
  code, and why you might be a good fit for their company.
